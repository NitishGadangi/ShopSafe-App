## About Shop Safe
As a safety measure during pandemic, all the Grocery Stores and Shops have made it compulsory for their customers to follow and stay in Queue outside the store until their spot comes. As a result, crowds have been forming outside the store which will be affecting the safety as Social Distancing is not properly followed. Additionally, it is also a waste of time standing in Queues. 

Shop Safe, is an app that revolutionaries this process of standing in queues with its efficiency and safety precautions.

Three Goals of Shop Safe:
1. Viruatise the Queues at Grocery Store and reduce crowding
2. Make Contact tracing simpler
3. Automatically notify user to Wear Mask when he step out of his home

Right from any location, Users can view waiting times and the number of people currently in Queue for shops near them to help them decide whether it's worth getting in line, just like how people would in a physical line. Users can queue up by joining a Queue at a click of a button and will eventually receive notifications when it's their turn to enter the store. This way users can use their time doing other work while standing in the Queue virtually.

ShopSafe is easy to use from a Store Managers perspective too as it provides seamless information about the users in the Queue and also updates them regularly.

Also, ShopSafe stores (locally) all the location information about the stores visited by the user. This can be used for Contact tracing purposes if a user gets infected. This will simplify the hectic process of finding all the places that are visited by an infected patient.

Additionally ShopSafe has an automatic system which notifies users to Wear Mask every time they step out of their home territory. It uses the location data provided by users paired with GeoFencing to make it automated.
